Description: This function takes a dataset of genotypes, at least one binary phenotype, and optionally environmental covariates. Bayesian lasso is used to find the posterior distributions of logistic regression coefficients, which are then used to calculate Bayes Factor and credible set to test for association with haplotypes, environmental covariates and interactions. The model can handle complex sampling data, in particular, frequency matched cases and controls with controls obtained using stratified sampling. This version can also be applied to a dataset with no environmental covariate and two correlated phenotypes (both can be binary or one is binary and the other one is continuous).
